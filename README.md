- 👋 Hi, I’m @diana-fsa
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, deep learning and many other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Korean language. Now that I finished my degree I want to keep learning more about all of what I most liked while studying like neural networks, different algorithms and how I can use them at the scientific field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun and challenging projects.
- 📫 You can reach me at dianafsa@proton.me
